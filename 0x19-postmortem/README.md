        A postmortem is a detailed report that outlines the causes, impact, and mitigation of an incident, such as an outage or failure in a 
system or application. The goal of a postmortem is to identify the root cause of the incident, assess the impact on the affected users, 
and outline the steps taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
        The postmortem typically includes a timeline of events leading up to the incident, a summary of the incident's impact on the users, 
and a detailed description of the root cause of the incident. It also outlines the steps taken to mitigate the incident and prevent similar 
incidents from happening in the future, such as implementing new processes or tools, upgrading systems, or improving monitoring and alerting.
         A postmortem is an essential tool for identifying and preventing future incidents, as it provides a detailed record of the incident 
and the steps taken to mitigate it. It can also help organizations improve their incident response processes, identify areas for improvement, 
and increase overall system reliability and uptime.
